       "'Been playing this for two days now, and I am very pleased so far. [Update: I\\'ve been playing for a week now, and I like it more and more as the days have gone by!]  People have spoken a lot about how things are different than Dragon Age: Origins.  I\\'m going to assume that you know that, and I\\'m going to focus on what I have enjoyed about this game so far.  First--the graphics are fantastic.  We just finished Final Fantasy XIII, which had spectacular graphics, and then we started Two Worlds II.  The graphics on Two Worlds II were such a comedown that we had to stop the game for a while so that we would stop expecting FFXIII style graphics.  Well, it looks like Two Worlds II will have to wait a little longer, because upon popping in this game, I was blown away by how beautiful everything looks. Movements are smooth and natural, the scenery is crisp and deeply detailed.  Monsters are terrifying.  Facial expressions are better than DA:O.  Sometimes moving in and out of the cut scenes is not as smooth as I would like, but that is a problem that no game designer has solved to my satisfaction yet.Next, the music.  The MUSIC!  I am a fan of film scores, and a fanatic of classical music.  This is probably one of the most interesting scores to a video game that I have yet heard--pieces of it are like parts of a concerto, with a solo instrument rising from the swell of the orchestra.  I looked into the composer, a man named Inon Zur.  He has composed music for a large number of other video games, and I hadn\\'t realized how much of his music I had heard before--Prince of Persia, Dragon Age: Origins, Fallout 3--and I will now make a point of listening to his scores.  Really enjoyable, even apart from the game.Voice acting is top notch.  I miss Claudia Black, from DA:0, of course, but aside from that (you can\\'t have her in everything!) the cast is spectacular.  Actors include Miranda Raison, from the BBC\\'s excellent series \"MI-5\", Nicholas Boulton, who plays the male version of Hawke here, and who played various voices in DA:0. He was also on the excellent BBC Series \"Doc Martin\".  Joanna Roth, also here from the BBC\\'s \"MI-5\", and Rebecca Stanton from the BBC\\'s \"Tess of the D\\'Urbervilles\" and \"Jane Eyre\" and a host of other good actors play the voices.  These are all working actors, none of whom have struck it rich but all of whom know their craft well.  They are given a good script and have taken it above the camp or kitsch it could have been and made it engrossing.The dialog wheel has received some comment--people have said that it is \"dumbed down\".  I don\\'t think that adding icons has made it any less intelligent, but it does give the player a little more understanding of what is going to be said and can help make the best choices for the path you wish the game to go.  I am actually happy with the icons next to the vocal parts, and have no issue with it.Combat is fun.  The combat runs smoothly and is exciting, but not too complicated.  That suits me perfectly, as I am not great at remembering fancy combinations--but I do want to look cool as I kick the Ogre\\'s rear end.  Spells are very colorful and exciting, sound effects are great.Storyline has really engaged me so far, but I am only two days into it.  I love getting lost in a world and lost in a story, but we also love side quests--there appears to be plenty of both so far.If you enjoyed DA:O, you will likely enjoy this game as well.  You should not expect it to be the same as before--there are differences, and some you may not like as much--but coming to this game with an open mind is sure to leave you impressed and pleased.  I look forward to many more hours of fun my first play through, and I\\'m already anticipating what I want to change for my second (or may be third!) play through the game!  From a guy who does not play most RPG games more than once, that is about as good an endorsement as I can give.----Update:After having this game for about a week, I\\'ve really enjoyed it even more than I did on my initial review.  Navigation from place to place is a snap, and I appreciate that you don\\'t have to spend a ton of time navigating from game area to game area.  I appreciate the way that quests are easily outlined and you can follow them in any order you want from place to place.  This makes things a little less \"realistic\" than Oblivion was, for instance, but makes playing a little more streamlined, and this i a compromise that I think is for the good.  Combat is really enjoyable, and the tactics are quite a lot of fun.  I love getting more tactic slots almost as much as I enjoy getting other leveling up treats.  The voice acting continues to be a standout for me, and the characters are a lot of fun.  I love the Dark Emporium (don\\'t manhandle the urchin, he\\'s not for sale...get your own!), and I enjoy the cut scene animations--beautiful and well done.  I wish there were a little more control over the weapons/armor for the secondary characters, and I don\\'t really understand why they took this away, because I play them almost as much as I play Hawke.  Even so, this is not a deal breaker when it comes to the fun.  The story line has gotten a couple of dings from some reviewers for not being strong, but I\\'m not sure that it is any weaker than the previous storyline--I\\'ve been enjoying it a lot and I feel quite connected to the characters. It is especially fun when there are references to the events in DA:O.  Although you don\\'t need to have played the first game to enjoy this one by any means, it does add a little spice, a little depth to the understanding of some of the political undercurrents in this adventure.  Ultimately, this game is as good as I had hoped, and better than I feared.  I can unhesitatingly say that it is a lot of great adventuring fun.--Update:My wife and I have now finished the game a couple of different ways.  I very much enjoyed the main story line, and felt attached to the characters as a whole.  I have a few criticisms after thinking carefully about the game, but my overall opinion is the same--it is quite fun.My problems--Sometimes the \"quests\" or tasks seem a little random and not well integrated with the overall story line.  I don\\'t mind a few random side quests that are completely stand alone, but I think that I would have preferred more side quest integration with secondary story lines.  This happened some, but could have been better.  After completing the game, I really did miss the chance to upgrade armor and weapons for my party members in a more controlled fashion.  Especially sad about Bianca--Bianca was cool and all, but she stayed the same while other available weapons would have been better, ultimately.  When you are going to give your crossbow a cool sexy name and then spend a lot of the game cooing over said crossbow, it had better be worth the inability to upgrade it.  We had a number of freezes.  Our PS3 is brand spanking new and so I can\\'t blame anything but the game.  Freezes are unacceptable in my mind, and are a big turn off.  Ultimately, it did not stop us from finishing the game, but it is frustrating and takes you out of the moment.I think that DA:II is a darn fine game, but it could have been better.  I do not rescind any stars, as it has held up already to repeated plays for us, but I hope that EA looks carefully at some of the suggestions (and anger!) from its fans and thinks carefully about how to improve the franchise.  Great graphics, great music, good story line, combat a little on the basic side, and limited upgrading options make this a cut above for the average gamer, but leave a little sadness for what might have been for those who are deeply dedicated to the franchise.  Play it, it\\'s worth it, but let EA know how you feel about the changes so they can know how to focus for their fans.'"
